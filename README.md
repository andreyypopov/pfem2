PFEM2 sources and cases

List of test cases:
1) 2D tube (non-parallelized (but optimized in terms of matrices' computation - once per run) and parallel);
2) 2D Poiseuille flow (two options of BCs);
3) 2D river discharge into ocean
4) 2D flow past a circular cylinder (cases with fixed and moving mesh)
